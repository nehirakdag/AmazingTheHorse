# Look At Thy Horse
Look at Thy Horse is a 3D game built in Unity. Amazing the horse finds himself in an unfamiliar eerie terrain, right across a ravine. There is an odd happening on the other side.

# Implementation
Includes a procedurally generated unicursal maze that is randomized at each instance, as well as AI Pathfinding boulders chasing the player through the maze. Projectile collision physics and item pickup triggering exit portal unlock included in the game.


# Procedurally Generated Unicursal Maze
Procedural generation allows mazes of arbitrary size to be created. Depth-First Search is used to create a perfect maze, then walls are placed at each passage to make the maze unicursal. Each maze contains three alcoves each with mysterious keys. The player must pick up all three keys to be able to escape the underground passage.
